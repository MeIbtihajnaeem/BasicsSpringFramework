## `com.javadev.learnspringframework`

Welcome to the main package of the "Learn Spring Framework" project. This package is the root of our project structure and contains two sub-packages: `com.javadev.learnspringframework.game` and `com.javadev.learnspringframework.helloWorld`.

## `com.javadev.learnspringframework.game`

The `com.javadev.learnspringframework.game` package is where the heart of our gaming application resides. It demonstrates how to use the Spring Framework to manage game configurations, define beans, and handle dependencies.

## `com.javadev.learnspringframework.helloWorld`

The `com.javadev.learnspringframework.helloWorld` package is a basic example that illustrates the core concepts discussed in the `com.javadev.learnspringframework.game` package. It serves as a simplified "Hello World" version of the topics covered in the gaming application.
