## Usage

Records are useful when you need to represent simple data structures. They provide the following benefits:

- **Conciseness:** You don't need to write boilerplate code for constructors and common methods.

- **Immutability:** Record components are implicitly declared as `final`, making records immutable by default.

- **Readability:** Records enhance the readability of your code, making it clear that the class is meant for data storage.

``

## Compatibility

Records are available starting from Java 16. If you are using an older version of Java, you won't be able to use this feature.

## Benefits and Limitations

- **Benefits:** Records simplify code, make it more readable, and reduce the potential for bugs by eliminating boilerplate code.

- **Limitations:** Records are designed for simple data structures and cannot be extended. If you need more complex behavior, you should use traditional classes.
