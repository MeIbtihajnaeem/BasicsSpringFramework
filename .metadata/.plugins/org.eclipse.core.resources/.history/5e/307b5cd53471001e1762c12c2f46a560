# Java Records

Java records are a new feature introduced in Java 16 that simplify the creation of classes for storing and managing data. Records provide a concise way to declare classes that are mainly used for encapsulating data and have automatic implementations of methods such as constructors, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.

## Syntax

To declare a record in Java, you use the `record` keyword followed by the name of the record and a list of components, each consisting of a type and a name. For example:

```java
record Person(String name, int age) {
    // Automatically generated constructor(s), equals(), hashCode(), and toString()
}
```

## Usage

Records are useful when you need to represent simple data structures. They provide the following benefits:

- **Conciseness:** You don't need to write boilerplate code for constructors and common methods.

- **Immutability:** Record components are implicitly declared as `final`, making records immutable by default.

- **Readability:** Records enhance the readability of your code, making it clear that the class is meant for data storage.

## Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
        Person person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

        System.out.println(person1); // Automatically generated toString()
        System.out.println(person1.equals(person2)); // Automatically generated equals()

        // Destructuring the record
        String name = person1.name();
        int age = person1.age();

        System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
    }
}
```

## Compatibility

Records are available starting from Java 16. If you are using an older version of Java, you won't be able to use this feature.

## Benefits and Limitations

- **Benefits:** Records simplify code, make it more readable, and reduce the potential for bugs by eliminating boilerplate code.

- **Limitations:** Records are designed for simple data structures and cannot be extended. If you need more complex behavior, you should use traditional classes.

## Conclusion

Java records are a powerful addition to the language, especially when you need to create classes that primarily store data. They reduce code verbosity and make your code more concise and readable.
